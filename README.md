This is my project, which is about profile website that contains 3 separate pages. This three pages can accessed from different routes.
My project accessed from 3 different routes, but I have problem with website(front-end). I used template and separated it to 3 php file, it can be accessed from routes, just can not show the main contents.
Screenshots of my website
